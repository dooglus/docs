What's in the box?
==================

So today you got your TREZOR.  Congratulations!  In the small box with the shiny TREZOR seal on it you should find:

- Your new TREZOR
- USB cable for your TREZOR
- A little booklet where you'll write down your recovery seed
- Your TREZOR user guide

.. note:: Your TREZOR doesn't have any batteries in it.  So you won't see anything on the screen until you plug it in.

Check the security seal
-----------------------

Make sure that the silver security seal is unbroken to ensure you are working with an authentic TREZOR device.

Go ahead and plug your TREZOR in now.  You should see the glowing TREZOR lock appear on the screen.  Now move on to :doc:`Setting up your TREZOR device <settingup>`.
