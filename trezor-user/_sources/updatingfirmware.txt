Updating your TREZOR's firmware
===============================

Occasionally you may plug in your TREZOR to see a banner telling you that you need an update.

That means its time to update your TREZORs firmware!

Doing so is easy.

.. important::  Make sure you have your recovery card handy before you begin your update, as you may be required to re-enter your recovery seed after the update has completed.

Without closing the myTREZOR website, unplug your TREZOR.  Now press down both buttons on your TREZOR.  Holding down the buttons, plug your TREZOR back in.  It may help if you hold your TREZOR from the top in a pinching motion.

Once you have plugged in your TREZOR you'll see a dialog on the myTREZOR.com website asking you if you want to update.

Press "Yes, update"

Now press the right button on your TREZOR to confirm the update.  Wait a few minutes while the update runs.  Once it's done you can unplug and replug your TREZOR to finish the update.

.. note:: If the update somehow fails or you accidentally unplug your TREZOR during the update there is no need to worry.  Run the update over again by plugging your TREZOR in with both buttons pressed down.  You will need to :doc:`forget your old device<forgetting>` and run :doc:`TREZOR recovery<recovery>`.
