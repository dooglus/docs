Logging out of myTREZOR.com
===========================

If you decide to use your TREZOR on a shared computer, such as at an internet cafe or library, you probably don't want myTREZOR to continue showing your device after you leave.  You can "log out" of myTREZOR by selecting your TREZOR device on the left panel and pressing forget device.
