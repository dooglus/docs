Transfering money to your TREZOR
=================================

If you already have bitcoins in a wallet somewhere, you can send bitcoins to your TREZOR simply by sending them to one of the addresses listed on your Account page as described in :doc:`receiving payments<receivingpayments>`.

If you don't have any bitcoins yet you'll either have to buy them, mine them, or sell something for them.  One good way to get bitcoins is to use a bitcoin ATM.  For this you'll need the QR code for one of your bitcoin accounts.  You can print this QR code out and use it with the ATM to change cash into bitcoins.

There are also many online bitcoin exchanges where you can change normal currency to bitcoins.  Most exchanges will also provide you with a service of holding your bitcoins for you in their own web wallet.  This is not safe at all and many people have lost their bitcoins by trusting them to such services.  If you buy bitcoins online, always make sure that you can send them to your TREZOR immediately after purchase!

.. important:: You can also use :doc:`receive applications <applications>` such as myTREZOR Lite.
