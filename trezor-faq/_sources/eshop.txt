--------------------------

If your country is not listed in the Delivery Address Form, let us know at `info@BuyTREZOR.com <mailto:info@buytrezor.com>`_.
We will try to include it as soon as possible.


How long does it take you to handle the order?
------------------------------------------

We process orders with the DHL Express shipping every working day and with the standard shipping 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). If an order is made before 12:00 CET on the shipping day, we ship the order the same day. We have all items in stock and we never postpone the shipping without prior customer notification.


What are the shipping options?
------------------------------

**DHL Express shipping** 

Default shipping option. DHL Express shipping which costs $29 and it's fully traceable.
Delivery time is usually 2-5 business days.

**Standard worldwide shipping**

You can also choose Standard shipping for $10 and the traceability is limited.
Delivery time may vary between 5 days to 6 weeks depending on your location and your national post.



Where can I follow my order (get a tracking number)?
----------------------------------------------------

By logging into `BuyTREZOR.com/user/login <https://www.buytrezor.com/user/login/>`_ and clicking order creation date on the My Orders page you can see the details of your order. Your user login have been created when you first purchased your TREZOR.

We will notify you of any significant change to your order by email as well.

You can track the parcel sent via DHL `here <http://www.dhl.com/en/express/tracking.html>`_. Parcel sent via Standard shipping `here <https://www.ceskaposta.cz/en/trackandtrace>`_ and when it leaves the country of origin then continue to the website of postal service in your country.


How do I know when my TREZOR is shipped?
----------------------------------------

You can follow the status of your order via your `BuyTREZOR.com User Profile <https://www.buytrezor.com/user/login>`_ which has been created after your first order. When your device is shipped we will notify you by email. Package leaves our warehouse within 48 hours latest (we are doing our best to shorten this period of time as much as possible) after receiving your payment.


Can you deliver one order to multiple address?
----------------------------------------------

We can't split orders already made, however you can create as many orders with different addresses under your BuyTREZOR.com User Profile.


My package didn't arrive yet. What can be the reason?
-----------------------------------------------------

As we mentioned before we never postpone the shipping without prior customer notification. If there is a delay even before the actual shipping, it might be caused by providing insufficient information required by the shipping company. In such case our Customer Support team contacted you and requested the missing information already.

After leaving the contry of origin, the parcel travels to foreign country where it is accepted at customs. This is where most of the delays actually happen and it is unfortunate because the delivery will appear in the customer's post tracking system only after it is released by the customs. For example, we have one delivery which was held by US customs office for nearly 6 weeks.

In rare cases, usually when chosing standard shipping, your package may not arrive at all. It is very unfortunate but it can happen occasionally. In such case we consider it as a **lost package** and we start the **investigation**.


How do I recognize my package got lost?
---------------------------------------

Investigation can be initiated if your package meets at least one of the following criterias:

- if package does not leave country of origin according to it's tracking in 10 days
- if package does not appear on foreign tracking in 21 days
- if the last update on foreign tracking is older than 10 days


How does the investigation work and how long does it take?
----------------------------------------------------------

Investigation process takes up to 6 weeks since your request due to processing time of post office in country of origin. Communication between you and us is essential during the investigation period to keep information on delivery status up to date. We send replacement product if package is not found or delivered within this period.


I want to start the investigation. What should I do?
----------------------------------------------------

In that case we will need you to contact us via support email `info@BuyTREZOR.com <mailto:info@buytrezor.com>`_ to initiate the investigation process.
