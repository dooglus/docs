Development Corner
===================

I want to participate on implementing TREZOR with my wallet or service.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We will be happy talking to you, please contact us at `integration@satoshilabs.com <mailto:integration@satoshilabs.com>`_.


Is it possible to flash the device?
-----------------------------------

Yes, it is. Devices sold by us have an USB bootloader that allows firmware flashing. Upon start the firmware signature is checked and if it does not match ours a warning is issued. User can continue on his own risk after pressing the button. This small inconvenience is to increase the security of the end users.


Where can I find the source codes?
----------------------------------

You can find all the repositories `here <../trezor-tech/resources.html>`_.
